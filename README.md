# Mobile-Phone-Price-Prediction-and-Feature-Extraction-
This project aims to enhance the pricing strategy of a mobile phone-selling organization by building a predictive model to estimate mobile phone prices based on various influential features. By performing comprehensive data exploration, preprocessing, feature extraction, and model building, we will identify key factors affecting mobile prices and provide actionable insights to inform business decisions.

#Problem Statement
The organization seeks to better understand the dynamics of mobile phone pricing in a competitive market. Given a dataset containing detailed attributes of mobile phones—including specifications such as model, color, memory, RAM, battery capacity, camera specifications, and more—the goal is to develop an accurate predictive model that estimates mobile phone prices. This model will not only facilitate informed pricing strategies but also help the organization optimize its product offerings based on key features that drive consumer purchasing decisions.
